For this assignment:

<ul>

 <li>You should select a technique from the following areas of optimization.</li>

 <li>Study the selected technique by reviewing related reference materials and understand its theory, working principles, and advantages/disadvantages.</li>

 <li>Create <strong>your own computer program</strong> to implement the selected technique.</li>

 <li>Solve few examples by your choice using the devised code.</li>

 <li>Compare the numerical results for your examples with another (rival) technique by your choice implemented in a computer program or software package.</li>

 <li>Finally, a report along with the devised code should be submitted.</li>

</ul>




<strong><u>Areas of Optimization:</u></strong>

<ul>

 <li><strong>Numerical Methods for Constrained Optimization</strong> (including but not limited to Sequential Quadratic Programming, Interior-point Method, Generalized Reduced Gradient Method, Gradient Projection Method, Active Set Methods)</li>

 <li><strong>Multi-Objective Optimization</strong> (including but not limited to Weighted Sum Approach, Lexicographic Method)</li>

 <li><strong>Modern Optimization Methods</strong> (including but not limited to Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing)</li>

 <li><strong>Dynamic Programming</strong></li>

 <li><strong>Integer Programming</strong> (including but not limited to Branch-and-Bound Method)</li>

 <li><strong>Stochastic Programming</strong> (including but not limited to Chance-Constrained Programming)</li>

<strong><u>Important Notes:</u></strong>

<ul>

 <li>The selected technique should be different from those optimization methods used in your group project.</li>

 <li>It is essential that all of the sections of the submitted report and code are your own individual and original work. You should also cite any reference materials that you have used.</li>
